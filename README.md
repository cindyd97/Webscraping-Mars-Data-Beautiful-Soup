# Webscraping Mars Data Utilizing Beautiful Soup
[Back to Portfolio](https://github.com/cindyd97/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Cindy)
### Description:
The first part of the assignment utilizes beautiful soup to extract the title and preview text from the elements of the HTML of a website that holds information about Mars. The second part of the assignment extracts Mars data and puts it into a data frame. Certain columns of the data frame are converted to floats and integers for analysis purposes. Bar charts and line graphs are created to display the month with the lowest average temperature, the month with the lowest average atmospheric temperature, and how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year.


### Language:
Python and Beautiful Soup Library

### Data Source:
The Mars News (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) is operated by edX Boot Camps LLC for educational purposes only. The news article titles, summaries, dates, and images were scraped from NASA's Mars News (https://science.nasa.gov/mars/) in November 2022. Images are used according to the JPL Image Use Policy (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jpl-image-use-policy/), courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.
